Keeping your web application in good shape is never ending process. Web application is something like living organism, it‚Äôs under development process for whole time and of course it‚Äôs changing whole time. Growing and learning new modern technologies.

Let‚Äôs take a look on possible way how to maintain and keep high standards for whole time.

First we need to evaluate website health, as we learn last time in article [What is web performance test?](/docs/news/what-is-web-perf) 
For our customers are important three pillars: 
Speed
Usability
Stability

1. Evaluate shape of web application
Using Field data we are able to simple get information about status of our web page. All of these data are real data from our customers. We are able to take a looks and focus on real problems. 

2. Optimisation
When we find where we have got problems or space to improvement (always is space to improvements, don‚Äôt worry). Now development team needs to be involved and using right tooling, their could be able to identify root cause and be able to find solution for fix.

3. Monitoring
When fix is implemented we are able to deliver fixed version to production. When it‚Äôs available we are able to again check field data with main performance metrics, but here we found limitation of Field data. We will receive outcome in more than one months. For validation of fix this is not a best way (long time, no improvement, etc‚Ä¶). Better way is to use tool for synthetic Web performance analysis n production, if we use it in good way (very often with proper setup) we are able to validate fix just after deployment to prod. That‚Äôs one benefit of Canarytrace. 

### Is it enough?
Today's web pages or web applications are very complex. Is not created only of development activities. But there are multiple 3rd party tools implement into. Such as marketing tool, performance tool, advertisement, Facebook and many other integrations. Validation only by field data without detail is not enough. Anything could be broken any time. New banner with bad image format or big size can brake whole web page. For this reason is good practise to automatically monitor web vitality by synthetic tool. You‚Äôll be immediately notified about any degradation from users point of view. 


If you implement while this round, and continuously monitor your web application. You can be proud of your application. And you‚Äôll be able to see how customers will be satisfied and will spend more time on your web side.
