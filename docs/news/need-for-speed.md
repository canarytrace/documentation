Do you know that faster websites generate more money?<br/>

When you improve the speed of your web , you are able to improve your conversion rate as well. 
By article [Speed up your website](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/speed-up-your-website/) a one second delay in page load time yields:<br/>

- 11% fewer page views
- 16% decrease in customer satisfaction
- 7% loss in conversions

<br/> <br/> 

Every extra second of loading time has a negative bounce on ability to engage your customers, produces less businesses and costs you more money.
And of course nobody likes slow websites :)
Remember, your feelings, when the loading time of the web site was really poor, what did you do?  :-)


For example at Zalando, they tested how artificially increasing the loading time on Catalog pages affected bounce rates, conversion rates, and revenue per user. The results were clear. A 100 milliseconds page load time improvement led to increased engagement with lower bounce rate and a 0.7% uplift in revenue per session. More information you can find in this article [How Zalando reduced performance feedback time from 1 day to 15 minutes with Lighthouse CI](https://web.dev/zalando/)

Another beautiful example is Bibli - How they achieved a 42% reduction in bounce rate, an 8x improvement in mobile conversion rate, and 2.5x more pages per session you can read here [Blibli's PWA generates 10x more revenue per user than their previous mobile website](https://web.dev/blibli/)


By statistics from Google, which collect data about the speed and traffic of websites, most users (53 %) leave the web if it does not load within three seconds. He also states that you have a 24% better chance that the users remains on the site if it meets the Web Vitals. [The business impact of Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals-business-impact/)

Do you know that Google, who supports 81 % of searches, prefers faster pages in their search results and it is happening more and more often.

Do not forget that the speed of your web is really important for your business.
