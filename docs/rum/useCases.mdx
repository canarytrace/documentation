# Use Cases

This page will show you several cases when it is appropriate to use Canarytrace RUM, what is important for you, and how to use it.
You will better understand how Canarytrace RUM can assist you, envision the benefits, and explore the possibilities.
It is also crucial to know how to implement Canarytrace for your specific use case.

Understanding how real users interact with your web application and how your web application performs for them, identifying their issues, and recognizing typical user journeys are critically important for your business.

## E-commerce

**Why does your e-shop need Canarytrace RUM?**
1. The e-shop must rank high in search results.
2. The shopping customer must be satisfied with the purchasing experience.
3. The customer should not abandon the purchase process but complete the order and make the purchase.
4. The customer is content with the purchase and will shop again in the future.

This is important for you.


**What do you need to know?**
1. How fast is loading your e-shop?
2. Is the catalog loaded quickly and without errors?
3. Monitoring user actions and how smoothly our e-shop works?

This is important for you to know. Without this information, you don't know the satisfaction of your clients, and you can't improve your e-shop.

Canarytrace RUM collects all important metrics directly from your clients' devices. You will obtain crucial information that answers the questions "**How satisfied are our clients with our e-shop?**" and "**Where do we have problems and what do we need to improve?**".
