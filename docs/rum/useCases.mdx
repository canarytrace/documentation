### How to start with the RUM

All problems mentioned above can be detected by Canarytrace RUM. You can begin using RUM by adding the following code named [`init script`](./rumClient#init-script) to every page or reusable component of your e-shop.

```javascript title="init script"
<script>
  (function(w,d,u,a,o){
  w=w[o]=w[o];w=document.createElement(u);w.async=1;w.id=o;w.src=a
  o=d.getElementsByTagName(u)[0];o.parentNode.insertBefore(w,o)
  })(window,document,'script','https://your-domain.com/rum','CRUM')
</script>
```
- More information about init script can be found in the [RUM Client](./rumClient#init-script) section.

That's really all. This is the first step, and in many cases, it is enough. The Canarytrace RUM will start collecting [all important data](./rumClient#browser-data-collected) from your clients' devices and send them to the Canarytrace RUM backend. You can view the data in the [Canarytrace RUM dashboard](./kibana).

- For successful integration, it is necessary to have a [Canarytrace RUM Server](./rumServer) running.

The Canarytrace RUM starts collecting data on pages where the user navigates, performance metrics, user-journeys, and information about the user's browser and device. This is enough for your first start. Thanks to this first phase, you will gather a lot of information about your e-shop and users, and thanks to this information, you will know how your e-shop works and what the user experience is like.

:::tip
For the first time, you can start with Canarytrace RUM on your development environment. If you have your e-shop in multiple countries, it's a good idea to start implementing it in the smallest country to gain a first overview, learn about performance metrics, and gain initial experience.

If you do not have these options, no problem, you can start directly on your production environment.

### More information better knowledge

If you have more information, you will know more important details about your e-shop and the satisfaction of your users. Now you can add features like [HeroElements](./rumClient#heroelements), [Actions](./rumClient#actions), and [Events](./rumClient#events).

[**HeroElements**](./rumClient#heroelements) can capture the time when arbitrary content is shown to the user's device. This can be used to measure the time when the user sees the important content of the page. For example, you can measure the time when the user views the product detail, the product list, or the cart.

[**Actions**](./rumClient#actions) capture user activities and the exact time when the user clicks on buttons or links. For example, you can measure the time when the user clicks on the button to add the product to the cart or when the user clicks on the button to complete the order, and others.

:::note Why is useful use Actions?
When a user clicks on a button, the e-shop executes certain procedures, such as loading data from the server, displaying a modal window, and so on. This is why it is essential to track button clicks. By doing so, we can measure the duration it takes to run the procedure and how long it takes to show the result to the user. This tracking allows us to monitor and optimize the performance and user experience on the e-shop.
:::

[**Events**](./rumClient#events) are useful for storing context. For example, the count of shown products, search results, filter settings, etc. Thanks to Canarytrace RUM, you have a lot of information about performance and user activities, but it's also helpful to know how many products users view, add to the cart, and buy, etc. Therefore, with the use of events, you will better understand the situation and the environment of the client, who is shopping in your e-shop.
