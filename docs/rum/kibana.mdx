## What is a Kibana?

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/kibana) Kibana is an free and open frontend application that sits on top of the Elastic Stack, providing search and data visualization capabilities for data indexed in [Elasticsearch](./elasticsearch).

We utilize Kibana as a powerful data visualization tool to interpret and analyze the data acquired from the [RUM Server](./rumServer) and stored in [Elasticsearch](./elasticsearch). Kibana enables us to gain valuable insights into the vitality and potential issues with the web pages monitored by Canarytrace on real client devices. By leveraging the capabilities of Kibana, we can effectively visualize and explore the data collected from Canarytrace RUM to identify performance patterns, diagnose problems, and make informed decisions for optimizing web performance.

**Všechny pohledy**
- Hlavní RUM vizualizace
- Failing Resources
- Users most affected by issues
- Sessions and trends, js errors, time spent 
- High memory consuption views
- Performance monitoring
	- Seznam top stranek a u nich CVW, TTFB, errors a devices
	- Seznam stranek s velmi nízkým score
- Detail vybraného view/stránky
	- prakticky stejné jako performance monitoring
	- chyby, trendy atp

## Visualizations
All data stored in Elasticsearch is organized in a timeline, so Kibana visualizations also display data on a timeline. In the visualizations below, you can see the timeline on the x-axis, while the y-axis displays the values of the metrics. The timeline can be adjusted to display data for a specific time period, such as the last 24 hours, last 7 days, or last 30 days. You can also zoom in on a specific time period by selecting a portion of the timeline. The data displayed in the visualizations will be updated to reflect the selected time period.

The data displayed in these visualizations is not truncated; what the [RUM Client](./rumClient) sends to the [RUM Server](./rumServer) is stored in Elasticsearch and displayed in Kibana.

### FPS and long tasks
One of the most useful visualizations for identifying a website's performance on a real device involves [Frames Per Second (FPS)](../glossary/webperf#fps) and [Long Task](../glossary/webperf#long-task) visualizations.

For your is important to know, that your web application run smoothly on the client device. The FPS and Long Tasks visualizations can help you identify performance issues that may be causing your web application to run slowly.

Lower is better.

![FPS and longtasks graph](./assets/kibana-fps-longtasks.webp)

This graph illustrates the FPS and Long Tasks for a specific page. The FPS is represented both as a line graph (actual) and as a bar graph (minimal), while the Long Tasks are depicted as red circles, each indicating the count of Long Tasks. FPS is measured in frames per second, whereas Long Tasks are measured in milliseconds. Both FPS and Long Tasks are plotted on a timeline, enabling a view of their changes over time.

This graph aggregate fields `view.fps.fps` and `view.longTasks.duration > 50` from `c.rum.metrics-*` index.
More information about [FPS](../glossary/webperf#fps) and [Long Tasks](../glossary/webperf#long-task).



### Active sessions
Easy view on active users which are currently work with your web application.
![Active sessions graph](./assets/kibana-active-sessions.webp)

This graph aggregates all unique `session.id` fields from the `c.rum.metrics-*` index, as each user has a unique session id. If a user is inactive for a long period, the session is closed and a new one is created. Read more about the [session lifecycle](../rum/rumClient#session).

### Metrics
This graphs show all important metrics on timeline and you can follow the relationships between them. For more information about metrics in this graph, please read our glossary [webperf](../glossary/webperf).

These graphs display all important metrics on a timeline, allowing you to track the relationships between them. For more information about the metrics in these graphs, please refer to our [web performance glossary](../glossary/webperf).

![Metrics graph](./assets/kibana-metrics.webp)

This graph aggregate fields: [`percentile(metrics.fcp, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#fcp), [`percentile(metrics.fid, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#fid), [`percentile(metrics.cls, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#cls), [`percentile(metrics.inp, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#inp), [`percentile(metrics.lcp, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#lcp), [`percentile(metrics.duration, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#duration), [`percentile(metrics.domComplete, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#domcomplete), [`percentile(metrics.domContentLoadedEventEnd, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#domcontentloadedeventend)

from the `c.rum.metrics-*` index.

### Hero Elements
Thanks to [Hero Elements](./rumClient#heroelements), you will know what was displayed to the user in the viewport on their real device. This could include elements such as the menu, images, text, products, server responses, etc.

![Hero Elements graph](./assets/kibana-hero-elements.webp)

This graph aggregates fields `max(view.marks.startTime)` from the `c.rum.metrics-*` index. More information about Hero Elements can be found in the [RUM Client](./rumClient#heroelements) documentation.

### Actions
This graph shows the number of clicks on the page. 

It is very useful to know which buttons and other parts of the your web are most used by users and together with [Visits pages](#visits-pages) you can identify the most important user actions and user journeys.

![Actions graph](./assets/kibana-actions.webp)

This graph shows `max(view.actions.timeStamp)` from the `c.rum.metrics-*` index. More information about Actions can be found in the [RUM Client](./rumClient#actions) documentation.

### Visits pages

This graph helps you to identify the most visited pages, how long users stay on the page, and how smoothly and quickly the pages load. It provides an instant look at the most important pages.

![Visits pages table](./assets/kiabana-visits-pages.webp)

This graph aggregates fields `view.id`, `unique_count(view.startTime)`, [`percentile(session.duration, percentile=95)`](./rumClient#session), [`percentile(view.fps.fps, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#fps) and [`percentile(metrics.lcp, percentile=95)`](../glossary/webperf#lcp) from the `c.rum.metrics-*` index.
