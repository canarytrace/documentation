## Elasticsearch

If you are experiencing issues with Elasticsearch, please use the `ELASTIC_OBSERVABILITY` property in your [RUM Server](./rumServer#settings) deployment. Enabling this property will activate Elasticsearch Observability, allowing you to see what is happening within Elasticsearch through the log of the [RUM Server POD](./rumServer#log).
