## Releases



### 2.9.3
Download: `docker pull quay.io/canarytrace/rum:2.9.3`

🚀 New Features
- Canarytrace RUM now collects the [WebRTC metrics](./rumClient#webrtc).


### 2.9.2
Download: `docker pull quay.io/canarytrace/rum:2.9.2`

🚀 New Features
- Canarytrace RUM now collects the **[Server-Timing](./rumClient/#server-timing)** header, which is useful for gathering speed metrics of your backend services directly in a user's browser. [#148](https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/148)

🐛 Bugs
- [Fix: userAgentData doesn't function as expected if the web page isn't in a secure context, #198](https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/198).




### 2.8.10
Download: `docker pull quay.io/canarytrace/rum:2.8.10`

🚀 New Features
- Monitoring the entire lifecycle of user actions on the page.
- Storing the latest [metrics](./rumClient#rumClient#browser-data-collected).
- New deployment script for Kubernetes. You can now run multiple instances of the Canarytrace RUM server in a Kubernetes cluster. This allows you to horizontally scale the Canarytrace RUM server and handle more traffic.

💥 Breaking Change
- The latest RUM from 2.8.10 is not compatible with Canarytrace RUM 1. Therefore, please remove older Elasticsearch indices and create new ones. More information about the new Elasticsearch indices can be found in the [documentation](./elasticsearch#indices).

📝 Documentation
- Welcome to the new documentation for Canarytrace RUM 2.8.10 and the entire Canarytrace toolset, which includes RUM, Listener, and Synthetic. This documentation is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). We hope you will like it. If you find any issues, please report them to us in the [Discussions](https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/discussions) section.
