# What is Real User Monitoring

Understanding how your web application performs for your end user or customer on their device is critical. It directly impacts your online business and customer satisfaction.

Canarytrace RUM provides insights into the user experience with your web application. It measures the application and browser performance on the user's device, details the loading time for various sections, and monitors the communication speed between the browser and server. It tracks user clicks and interactions, identifying any performance issues such as response time and smoothness.

Furthermore, it records user paths, helping identify whether your application runs flawlessly on user devices, or if there are any issues concerning violations of CSP security policies. 

In short, Canarytrace RUM enhances your understanding of user experience, enabling you to optimize accordingly for business success.
