# What is Real User Monitoring

Understanding how your web application performs for your end user or customer on their device is critical. It directly impacts your online business and customer satisfaction.

Canarytrace RUM provides insights into the user experience with your web application. It measures the application and browser performance on the user's device, details the loading time for various sections, and monitors the communication speed between the browser and server. It tracks user clicks and interactions, identifying any performance issues such as response time and smoothness.

Furthermore, it records user paths, helping identify whether your application runs flawlessly on user devices, or if there are any issues concerning violations of CSP security policies. 

In short, Canarytrace RUM enhances your understanding of user experience, enabling you to optimize accordingly for business success.

- **Security**: Quick detection of potential security threats and ensuring that websites are safe for visitors.
- **Performance Optimization**: Identification of performance bottlenecks and addressing them to deliver a smooth and fast user experience.

**Monitoring and Measurement**:
- Monitoring end-user satisfaction in production.
- Measures the speed of communication between the backend and frontend.
- Measures how quickly different parts of the web application load.
- Measures the most used parts of the web application and the number of active users.
- Measures non-functional parameters of the web application, suitable for monitoring in test environments, in production, and before and after release.

**Details and Diagnostics**:
- Measures the resources loaded by the web application and their size and type.
- RUM obtains information about the used browser, the end user's device, its type, and performance.
- Captures web application errors, CSP security policy violations, and user events, such as a user viewed something or a user submitted a form, etc.

**Effortless Monitoring & Observability**:
- Offer effortless monitoring and observability for web applications you deliver to your customers. This allows you to detect when the software you provide does not meet SLA or has other issues.

**RUM Over Synthetic Monitoring**:
