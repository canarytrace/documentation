# Listener Agent

The Listener Agent is a Dockerized component that evaluates data from Canarytrace [RUM](../rum/introduction) and Canarytrace Synthetic, which are stored in Elasticsearch.

The Listener Agent works in phases:

1. First phase, internal checks: The Listener Agent contains built-in internal checks which i verify that Canarytrace is functioning correctly, that Elasticsearch is available, and that it's possible to store data in Elasticsearch.

2. Second phase, rule checking: The Listener Agent contains built-in rules, like a checklist for the quality of the web application. The Listener Agent checks stored data against these rules very frequently. Thanks to these rules, you do not need know how the web application works properly.

3. Third phase, reporting: All information about the work of the Listener Agent and violations of rules are stored in an Elasticsearch index called "events", and notifications are sent through reporters. This phase also includes bug watchers and creates an overview.

## Docker image

The Listener Agent is distributed as a [Docker](https://quay.io/repository/canarytrace/listener-agent?tab=tags) image and we recommend running it in a Kubernetes cluster.


:::tip Please always use a latest Docker image
- List of Docker image tags https://quay.io/repository/canarytrace/listener-agent?tab=tags
:::

The [Docker](https://quay.io/repository/canarytrace/listener-agent?tab=tags) image contains not only the Listener engine itself but also built-in rules and the necessary Kubernetes deployment objects.

Upon launching the Docker image with the Listener Agent, the creation of service indices in Elasticsearch happens automatically, followed by the start of individual phases. Once the final phase ends, the Docker image stops and restarts. Thanks to this, the Listener Agent evaluates current data from Canarytrace RUM and Canarytrace Synthetic.

For optimal operation, it's necessary to run the Listener Agent in a Kubernetes cluster. More information can be found in the [Kubernetes](#kubernetes) section.


## Kubernetes

To run the Listener Agent, you need a Kubernetes deployment that includes the Docker image, resources, configurations, and additional parameters. We provide a deployment that you can use as is or modify to your preferences.

### Resources

- To deploy the Listener Agent Server on Kubernetes, several requirements need to be met, including specifying the appropriate resource requests and limits.
- In most cases, one instance of the Listener Agent will be sufficient.

|Resources|CPU Request|CPU Limits|Memory requests|Memory limits|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|One instance of the Listener Agent|`50m`|`200m`|`50Mi`|`300Mi`|


### Deployment

All deployment objects necessary for running the RUM Server are packaged and distributed inside the Docker image. This includes any required configuration files, scripts, and dependencies needed for the deployment process.

#### Download the deployments scripts from the Docker image

```bash title="Download deployments scripts from docker image"
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/mv -v $(pwd):/k8s quay.io/canarytrace/listener-agent:1.42 /opt/canary-listener/k8s/ /k8s/
```

```bash title="Print directory k8s"
ls -lah k8s 
-rw-r--r--@ 1 rdpanek  staff   788B 31 pro  2022 config-custom-rules.yaml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 rdpanek  staff   9,8K 31 pro  2022 config-internal-rules.yaml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 rdpanek  staff   4,7K 31 pro  2022 config-rum-rules.yaml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 rdpanek  staff   3,9K 31 pro  2022 deployment.yaml
-rw-r--r--@ 1 rdpanek  staff   357B 31 pro  2022 secret.yml
```

- `k8s/config-rum-rules.yaml` - contains configuration of rules for [Canarytrace RUM](../rum/rumClient), more information in the [Rules](#rules) section.
- `k8s/config-internal-rules.yaml` - contains configuration of internal rules for Canarytrace Synthetic, more information in the [Rules](#rules) section.
- `k8s/config-custom-rules.yaml` - contains configuration of your custom business rules. More information in the [Rules](#rules) section.
- `k8s/secret.yaml` - contains Listener configuration, more information in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
- `k8s/listener.yaml` - contains deployment of Listener Agent, more information in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

Before deploying the Listener Agent to your Kubernetes cluster, please:
- update the `secret.yaml` and `listener.yaml` files and their configurations.
- additionally, you may choose to edit the rules in one or more of these files:" `k8s/config-custom-rules.yaml`, `k8s/config-internal-rules.yaml`, and `k8s/config-rum-rules.yaml`. Learn more about the syntax of the rules in the [Rules](#rules) section.

:::tip
Configuration files with rules are in the YAML format. You don't need to edit these files or values if the default configuration meets your requirements.
:::


Deploy these objects to Kubernetes in this order:

1. `k8s/secret.yaml`
2. `k8s/config-custom-rules.yaml`
3. `k8s/config-internal-rules.yaml`
4. `k8s/config-rum-rules.yaml`
5. `k8s/deployment.yaml`

All Kubernetes objects can be deployed using the `kubectl -n` command, followed by the name of the namespace and the `create` option. For example, to deploy a `secret.yaml` file, you would use the command `kubectl -n canarytrace create -f secret.yaml`.

### Check the deployment

Please check, that the Canarytrace Listerer Agent is deployed and running.

Secrects contains configuration of Listener Agent such as connection to Elasticsearch, Slack webhook, etc. More information in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
```bash title="Check Secrects"
kubectl -n canarytrace get secrets

// result
NAME                               TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
listener-agent-secret              Opaque                                10     451d
```


ConfigMaps contains configuration of rules for [Canarytrace RUM](../rum/rumClient), more information in the [Rules](#rules) section.
```bash title="Check ConfigMaps"
kubectl -n canarytrace get configmaps

// result
NAME                            DATA   AGE
listener-agent-custom-rules     1      213d
listener-agent-internal-rules   1      213d
listener-agent-rum-rules        1      213d
```

The CronJob configuration includes settings for the Listener Agent, such as the version of the Docker image and Kubernetes deployment settings, etc. More information can be found in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.
Thanks to [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/), the Listener Agent starts every 10 minutes to check new data from Canarytrace RUM and Canarytrace Synthetic. The ten-minute interval is a default value, which can be modified in the `k8s/deployment.yaml` file.
```bash title="Check CronJobs"
kubectl -n canarytrace get cronjob

// result
NAME                          SCHEDULE       SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
listener-agent                */10 * * * *   False     0        6m15s           199d
```

Pods run the Listener Agent instances. Every 10 minutes, the CronJob creates a [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/) with the Listener Agent.
But in this example, you see three Pods of the Listener Agent. This means that you're seeing the three most recent instances of the Listener Agent. Therefore, the latest run was 7 minutes ago, the previous run was 17 minutes ago and the first run was 26 minutes ago. 

You can read logs from the three most recent instances of the Listener Agent. More information can be found in the [Log](#log) section.
```bash title="Check Pods"
kubectl -n canarytrace get pods

// result
NAME                                         READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
listener-agent-28161260-grp2f                0/1     Completed   0          27m
listener-agent-28161270-84pwc                0/1     Completed   0          17m
listener-agent-28161280-2d6df                0/1     Completed   0          7m21s
```

In other cases, you may see a state of pods where one of them has the STATUS `Running`. This means that the Listener Agent is currently executing.
```bash title="Check Pods with running the Listener Agent"
kubectl -n canarytrace get pods

// result
NAME                                         READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
listener-agent-28161400-f4sjv                0/1     Completed   0          30m
listener-agent-28161410-8tnvn                0/1     Completed   0          20m
listener-agent-28161420-l94gv                0/1     Completed   0          10m
listener-agent-28161430-bnrkl                1/1     Running     0          2s
```

### Log

You can access the log of the Listener Agent from the three most recent instances. To retrieve these logs, you'll need to know the name of the Pod. You can determine the Pod's name from the previous step.


With this Kubernetes command `logs`, you will be able to see the log.
```bash title="Get logs"
kubectl -n canarytrace logs listener-agent-28161280-2d6df
```

The first phase is the initiation of internal checks. The Listener Agent examines the health of Elasticsearch, Canarytrace RUM, and Canarytrace Synthetic.

The internal checks are the most important phase, which verifies the health of the Canarytrace toolset and Elasticsearch.

```bash title="The Listener Agent start internal checks"
    __    _      __                      
   / /   (______/ /____  ____  ___  _____
  / /   / / ___/ __/ _ \/ __ \/ _ \/ ___/
 / /___/ (__  / /_/  __/ / / /  __/ /    
/_____/_/____/\__/\___/_/ /_/\___/_/     
                                         
Listener agent: 1 https://canarytrace.com
Node.js: v18.7.0
Listener:lastRuleCheck used is: 2023-07-18T13:10:05.247Z
Listener:rule-analyzer:start
Elasticsearch health check: green, pending: 0
Elasticsearch nodes: 4, max heap: 53%, max ram: 97%, max disk used 2.37%, max cpu 7%, node with highest heap tiebreaker-0000000018
Canarytrace health check: running
Canarytrace lifecycle: OK
DataManager exist: OK
Datamanager: last run before 13 hours
...
```

The second phase, marked as the analysis phase, is when the Listener Agent loads and evaluates rules, and prepares data for the final phase, known as the overview phase. During the analysis phase, rules are evaluated, notifications for critical problems are sent out, and new errors are added to the error queue.

```bash title="The Listener Agent evaluate rules"
...
Listener: load internal rules.
Listener: loaded 20x internal rules from ./rules/internal.yaml
Listener: load custom rules from ./rules/custom.yaml
Listener: loaded 1x custom rules.
Listener: load RUM rules from ./rules/rum.yaml
Listener: loaded 10x RUM rules.
Listener agent: evaluate 31 rules
---------------------------------

Load time needs improvement, filter: (loadEventEnd gte 3000),(loadEventEnd lt 5000),
analyzers: incidents 0

Load time is poor, filter: (loadEventEnd gte 5000),
analyzers: incidents 0
...
```

In this phase, the Listener Agent evaluates the error queue, for instance, updating the status of the errors or closing old errors.

```bash title="The Listener Agent evaluate incidents"
...
errors-queue:queue size 1
errors-queue:closing: 1 incidents older 30 minutes.
errors-queue:how long:9min: Performance score needs improvement
errors-queue:not closed
...
```
The Overview phase is the final phase of the Listener Agent. In this phase, the Listener Agent generates reports and sends them to the configured reporters. It evaluates numerous parameters such as the age of errors and their score, available reporters, appropriate time for sending the report, sentence preparation for improved explanation, and so on.

```bash title="The Listener Agent create reports"
...
Listener:overview:lastEmergencyOverview: check after 60 minutes
Listener:overview:lastEmergencyOverview: last emergency check has taken place before 50 minutes
Listener:overview:stage1: check after 180 minutes
Listener:overview:stage1: stage1 check has taken place before 170 minutes

-------------------------------
Listener aget: uuid: d55bdef17866afdb8e62fddfca3c7a98
Start: Tue Jul 18 13:20:01 UTC 2023
End: Tue Jul 18 13:20:09 UTC 2023
...
```
## Score

All processes in the Listener Agent are governed by a score, which represents the severity of the problem. Each type of defect (Internal checks, Rules/Checklist) has its own score, and the Listener Agent considers this score when deciding what to do with the discovered defect.

**Canarytrace toolkit uses these score tables**

Description | Score | Color
-- | -- | --
needs fix! | 0-30 | red
needs improvement! | 31-70 | orange
good job! | 71-100 | green

- This score table is used in rule definitions, for color coding reporters, and for overview reports. The score also controls alerting.
- The score defines the impact on a real user from 0 = very poor to 100 percent = excellent.

The default rule applies, that a score below 30 is an emergency problem, for example: Performance Score is poor, or Response code 500, or Elasticsearch nodes: java heap is higher than 85%. Events with such a low score represent a problem with the monitored application or an inability to monitor the application.

For instance, if you do not use Data Manager (event: DataManager exists: Not found.), it is not an emergency problem right now, so the score is higher than 30. But, if you do not clean data in Elasticsearch, you will receive a notification about the java heap in Elasticsearch filling up, with a low score.

## Internal checks

Interní checky kontrolují vše potřebné, aby nic nebránilo monitorovat webové aplikace, jako je například to, jestli Canarytrace běží, jestli je Elasticsearch dostupný a jestli není přetížen a nevyžaduje údržbu. 


Title | Score
-- | --
Elasticsearch health check: yellow | 50
Elasticsearch health check: red | 0
Elasticsearch nodes: java heap is higher than 80% | 50
Elasticsearch nodes: java heap is higher than 85% | 0
Elasticsearch nodes: disk used percentage is higher than 85% | 30
Canarytrace health check: missing data | 0
Canarytrace lifecycle errors | 30
DataManager exist: Not found. | 31

- [Reporters](#reporters) `internal-slack`
- Internal checks are run when Listener agent start and before rules check.

## Rules / Checklists

Listener agent je dodáván s předem definovanými pravidly, takže reálně nemusíte ze začátku do konfigurace vůbec zasahovat. Nic méně, určitě budete chtít některá pravidla měnit a proto můžete built-in pravidla přetížit. K tomu se používají 3 soubory

- `rules/internal.yaml` pro pravidla kvality webových aplikací, obzvláště pro kontrolu dat z Canarytrace.
    - Seznam pravidel https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/110#issuecomment-1288031254
- `rules/rum.yaml` s pravidly pro kontrolu dat z RUM.
    - Seznam pravidel https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/110#issuecomment-1288045409
- `rules/custom.yaml` pro Vaše vlastní business pravidla
    - Obsahuje pouze ukázku možného business pravidla ( maximální čas pro přihlášení uživatele do aplikace )

Všechny tři soubory se deployují do Kubernetes jako [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) a jejich obsah můžete za běhu měnit. Změny se projeví při dalším startu Listener agenta.

Jednotlivá pravidla jsou v těchto souborech definována pomocí typů [range](https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/110#issuecomment-1364990113), [contains](https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/110#issuecomment-1365282100) a [match](https://github.com/canarytrace/documentation/issues/110#issuecomment-1365444676). Pomocí těchto typů můžete upravit či postavit robustní seznam pravidel pro Vaše business thresholdy.

Syntaxe v pravidlech slouží pro vygenerování dotazu do Elasticsearch, takže: 

pokud je pravidlo pravdivé ⇒ dotaz v Elasticsearch našel data, které pravidlu odpovídají ⇒ založení události ⇒ reportování

### custom rules

> source: rules/custom.yaml

This file contains only example rule.

## Rule syntax

- The listener-agent load and parsing a rules from files `rules/internal.yaml`, `rules/rum.yaml` and `rules/custom.yaml`. You can use one from three type of rules. Each rule type has different syntax and different use case. 
- All these files with rules are inside into the Docker image with listener-agent. If you want change some value or some rule or if you want delete or add a new rule, you can override these files with your own set of rules. Just create a config-map and deploy them into Kubernetes.


**Example of one rule definition**
- This rule is type `range`, searching items with a label `loadEventEnd` with value between 3000 and 5000 ms in `c.performance-entries` index.
- If the listener-agent finds minimal 5 items, automatically save event into `c.listener.events` index and send report into slack.
- For creating report body are used additional labels `loadEventEnd` and `timestamp`.

```yaml
  - type: range
    title: "Load time needs improvement"
    index: c.performance-entries
    filter:
    - field: 'loadEventEnd'
      operator: 'gte'
      value: 3000
    - field: 'loadEventEnd'
      operator: 'lt'
      value: 5000
    min: 5
    score: 40
    reportLabels:
    - 'loadEventEnd'
    - 'timestamp'
    reporters:
    - type: slack
      message: "Page is complete loaded."
```

### type `range`

**Example rule**

> This rule evaluate if exists minimal 5 items in `c.performance-entries` index and if these items has label `loadEventEnd` with value between `3000` and `5000`ms

```yaml
rules:
  - type: range
    title: "Load time needs improvement"
    index: c.performance-entries
    filter:
    - field: 'loadEventEnd'
      operator: 'gte'
      value: 3000
    - field: 'loadEventEnd'
      operator: 'lt'
      value: 5000
    min: 5
    score: 40
    reportLabels:
    - 'loadEventEnd'
    - 'timestamp'
    reporters:
    - type: slack
      message: "Page is complete loaded."
```

**Mandatory parts**
- `title` name of this rule definition
- `index` Elasticsearch labels
- `score` define score by score table, more info in chapter [Score table](#score-table)
- `reporters` are list of reporters type, which are you want use for sending notice about the rule exceeded. You must use at least one reporter type and you can combine them. E.g. only `slack` or ( `slack` and `email`  )

**Optional parts**
- `filter` is array of filters. Each filter must contains:
  - `field` name of field from Elasticsearch index
  - `operator` can contains value `lt`, `lte`, `gt` and `gte` and
  - `value` 
 - `min` this rule will be true only in case, that was found minimal `min` items in Elasticsearch index. If is not `min` used, will be the listener-agent report all findings.
