Set up Elasticsearch and Kibana it's also fast, thanks to prepared Canarytrace Installer.

> ### Important

- Choose the right version according to the [docker image tag](https://quay.io/repository/canarytrace/installer?tab=tags)

- Dockerized - the [docker image](https://quay.io/repository/canarytrace/installer) tag corresponds to the version of the Elasticsearch for which it is intended 
- Ready for [Canarytrace](/docs/why/edition/) and for [Canarytrace Pro](/docs/why/edition/)
- Ready for local use
- Ready for use on elastic.co

### What does installation contain?

- **Install index patterns**
  - Index patterns tell Kibana which Elasticsearch indices you want to explore. An index pattern can match the name of a single index, or include a wildcard (*) to match multiple indices.
- **Install templates**
  - An index template is a way to tell Elasticsearch how to configure an index when it is created.
- **Install visualizations**
  - Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data from your Elasticsearch indices, which you can then add to dashboards for analysis.
- **Install dashboards**
  - A dashboard is a collection of visualizations, searches, and maps, typically in real-time. Dashboards provide at-a-glance insights into your data and enable you to drill down into details.

## Command Line

This setting allows you to change the default setting. For example, Elasticsearch runs somewhere in the cloud.

- `ELASTIC_ENDPOINT=http://localhost` for local installation of Elasticsearch or `elasticsearch` if you use `--net canary` bridge or `https://1234.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.es.io` if you use elastic.co
- `ELASTIC_PORTT=9200` this is a default REST-API port of Elasticsearch
- `ELASTIC_INDEX_PREFIX=c` default is `c`, e.g. index `c.report-*`
- `ELASTIC_USER=elastic`
- `ELASTIC_PASS=12345`
- `KIBANA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost` for local installation of Elasticsearch or `kibana` if you use `--net canary` bridge or `https://1234.eu-central-1.aws.
- `KIBANA_PORT=5601`
- `KIBANA_USER=elastic`
- `KIBANA_PASS=@josePh8`

## Example with docker-compose and elastic.co
> docker-compose contains configuration for prepare Elasticsearch and Kibana on elastic.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: "3.8"
services:
  installer:
    image: quay.io/canarytrace/installer:7.10.0
    environment:
      ELASTIC_ENDPOINT: 'https://XXX.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.es.io'
      ELASTIC_PORT: 9243
      ELASTIC_INDEX_PREFIX: 'c.'
      ELASTIC_USER: 'elastic'
      ELASTIC_PASS: 'XXX'
      KIBANA_ENDPOINT: 'https://XXX.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.es.io'
      KIBANA_PORT: 9243
      KIBANA_USER: 'elastic'
      KIBANA_PASS: 'XXX'
