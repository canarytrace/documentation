  - Index patterns tell Kibana which Elasticsearch indices you want to explore. An index pattern can match the name of a single index, or include a wildcard (*) to match multiple indices.
- **Install templates**
  - An index template is a way to tell Elasticsearch how to configure an index when it is created.
- **Install visualizations**

This setting allows you to change the default setting. For example, Elasticsearch runs somewhere in the cloud.

- `ELASTIC_PORTT=9200` this is a default REST-API port of Elasticsearch
- `ELASTIC_INDEX_PREFIX=c` default is `c`, e.g. index `c.report-*`
- `ELASTIC_USER=elastic`
- `ELASTIC_PASS=12345`
- `KIBANA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost` for local installation of Elasticsearch or `kibana` if you use `--net canary` bridge or `https://1234.eu-central-1.aws.
- `KIBANA_PORT=5601`
- `KIBANA_USER=elastic`
- `KIBANA_PASS=@josePh8`

```yaml title="docker-compose.yaml"
version: "3.8"
services:
  installer:
    image: quay.io/canarytrace/installer:1.0
    environment:
      ELASTIC_ENDPOINT: 'https://XXX.eu-central-1.aws.cloud.es.io'
