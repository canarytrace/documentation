<a href="/docs/why/edition#canarytrace-pro"><span class="canaryBadge">Canarytrace Pro</span></a>

Canarytrace collects requests on resources e.g. (javascript and css) and measures how much percentage is not used. All data are saved into [`c.coverage-audit-*`](/docs/features/live-reporting#ccoverage-audit-) Elasticsearch index.
Coverage audit is ideal to monitor if you want to speed up web loading and if you want to save on data transfer in the cloud.
